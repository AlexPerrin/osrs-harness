## Change
Split from server-clan-channels (the user, 2026-10-31: clans in five PRs, in order, each off upstream main: core, guest clans, settings interfaces, broadcasts, Clan Hall). This PR: guest clans (join, chat and leave another clan's channel as a guest), as on the OSRS wiki, built on the clans core. Draft spec: /home/alex/osrs-harness/evidence/server-clan-channels/accuracy.md. Cross-world clans are a stated caveat.

## Definition of done
- the gate passes; the review passes (scope, upstream style, PR text, in game on a branch server)
- mergeable as it stands; after the user's yes the PR leaves draft once upstream CI is green
