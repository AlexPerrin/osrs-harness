  in any scene)'

Blocks the client-api probe's WorldEntity (9) and WorldEntityConfig (6) rows (client change client-api-probe-reach): WorldView.worldEntities() is always empty in the Android host, so they stay unreached.

Repro on the test server: anywhere in the world, WorldView.worldEntities() on the top-level world view is empty; no content spawns one. Source: in the fork, RegionRegistry.registerWorldEntity() has no caller, the WorldEntityInfo supplier (api/net rsprot/provider/WorldEntityProvider.kt) never gets an avatar, and there is no Sailing content.

Expected (official): world entities (Sailing boats, and the other world-entity content since 2025) are sent through WORLDENTITY_INFO with their own world view; the client builds a WorldEntity with its config (bounds, category, id). Minimum to unblock the client: one world entity (e.g. a boat) spawned in a scene the tester can reach.
